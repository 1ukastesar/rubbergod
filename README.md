# Discord bot for the VUT FIT discord server

## About

This bot manages the verification process, karma and a bunch of simple commands
on our VUT FIT discord server. Since most of the features are custom-made I
wouldn't recommend using it for different servers.

## Installing and running the bot

Prerequisities:
* Mysql
* Python3.6+

Start by cloning the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/toaster192/rubbergod.git
```

Install the required python modules (`venv` / `--user` flag recommended):
```
cd rubbergod
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the bot (might want to use `nohup` or something):
```
python3 __main__.py
```
